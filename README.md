# Dog Breed Classifier

This project shows a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that recognizes human faces and dog breeds. The project allows users to provide images, and it can tell if the images are of humans or dogs or neither. Furthermore, if users provide dog images, the algorithm will report the breeds of the dogs.

The accuracy for identifying human faces is 96%.
The accuracy for classifying dog breeds is 83%.
